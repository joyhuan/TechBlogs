## JDK
The JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is the Java platform component that executes programs.

The JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is the on-disk part of Java that creates the JVM.

The JDK(Java Development Kit) allows developers to create Java programs that can be executed and run by the JVM and JRE.

The distinction is that the JDK is a package of tools for developing Java-based software, whereas the JRE is a package of tools for running Java code.

The JRE can be used as a standalone component to simply run Java programs, but it's also part of the JDK. The JDK requires a JRE because running Java programs is part of developing them.

Technical definition: The JDK is an implementation of the Java platform specification, including compiler and class libraries.

Everyday definition: The JDK is a software package you download in order to create Java-based applications.

## SDK

SDK stands for software development kit or devkit for short. Itâ€™s a set of software tools and programs used by developers to create applications for specific platforms.
